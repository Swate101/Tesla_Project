Im not really sure how i am going to do it, but with my market experience I am going to make something 



# Finally, an original project



# Some Data Dictionary Items Gen Stuff to know about investing, it would behoove you to learn this stuff !

Simple Moving Average (SMA): Average of the price of stock for a set period of time, in our case we have used a simple moving average of 5,10,15 and 30 days.

Exponential Moving Average (EMA): An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points, basically what it means is that the newer stock price data has a higher weightage/significance on the price than older days.

Relative Strength Index (RSI): A momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock.

Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. Similar to RSI, MACD triggers technical signals when it crosses above (to buy) or below (to sell) its signal line.

# Also, for you History buffs it is time to meet the Greeks !!
I will introduce my friends ---->


Delta, I help you gauge the likelihood an option will expire in-the-money (ITM), meaning its strike price is below (for calls) or above (for puts) the underlying security’s market price.



Gamma, I can help you estimate how much the Delta might change if the stock price changes.



Theta, I can help you measure how much value an option might lose each day as it approaches expiration.



Vega, I can help you understand how sensitive an option might be to large price swings in the underlying stock.




Rho, I can help you simulate the effect of interest rate changes on an option.


## We are the Greeks, "nice to meet you !".
