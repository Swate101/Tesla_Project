Simple Moving Average (SMA): Average of the price of stock for a set period of time, in our case we have used a simple moving average of 5,10,15 and 30 days.

Exponential Moving Average (EMA): An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points, basically what it means is that the newer stock price data has a higher weightage/significance on the price than older days.

Relative Strength Index (RSI): A momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock.

Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. Similar to RSI, MACD triggers technical signals when it crosses above (to buy) or below (to sell) its signal line.
